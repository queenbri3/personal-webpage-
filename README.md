# 'The Daily Bite'
http://localhost:8080/index.html
## Introduction
Foe this assignment, I decided to do my website based on cooking. It is a place where you can get recipes from different levels and also submit your own recipes via a form so that others can use it as well. 
## User Experience (UX)
### User Stories (US)

1. As a stay at home mother, I want to find quick and healthy recipes, so that my kids can eat healthier.
2. As an inspiring private chef, Im looking to find new recipes from all cooking levels so that I can improve my cooking skills and develop my own recipes.

### Design Choices -'change as per your needs include old and revised wireframes '
background: #af7373;
box-shadow: 0px 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
color: #5A2C2C;
color: #7e4949; 
These are some of the colours I used for a background, the logo and even the buttons. 
- I will be using __black__ colour text against the _white_background colours.

- **typography**
- I used bold text and non bold text to make it easy to read
- Made the text a bigger size e.g. 60px
- I used a readable font e.g. Arial throughout the pages
- **Imagery**
- I obtained some of the images from google, BBC goodfood website, also a logo genrator to obtain the logo of the webpage
- **Wireframes**
- I stuck to the original wireframe throughout the webpages.
- The only wireframe that I decided to change was the form to make it more accessible.
